The solution is to modify the CSS selector to be more specific, targeting only the intended element for the pseudo-element.  Here's how you can fix it:

```css
.container .specific-element:before {
  content: "Example";
  display: block;
}

.element {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

By adding `.specific-element` to the selector, we ensure that the `:before` pseudo-element only applies to the intended target. This helps to avoid conflicts with other elements using pseudo-elements within the same `.container`.
