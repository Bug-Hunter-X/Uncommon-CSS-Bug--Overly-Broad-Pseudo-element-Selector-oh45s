The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the selector for the `:before` pseudo-element is too broad, unintentionally affecting elements other than the intended target. 

```css
.container:before {
  content: "Example";
  display: block;
}

.element {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

```

The `:before` pseudo-element is applied to all elements within the `.container` class. In certain situations, this could lead to unexpected behavior when another element within the same container also uses the `:before` pseudo-element. This may result in cascading issues due to the specificity of selectors.
